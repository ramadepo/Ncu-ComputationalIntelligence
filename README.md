Overview
===
It's the homework in Computational Intelligence, implemented by **Unity Engine** and **C#**.

 Use fuzzy rule and swarm intelligence to calculate appropriate steering wheel degree *Î¸* to make car(player) rotate, finally go to the goal without hit the wall.

There's two scenes in this Unity project:
- **HW1** : Using fuzzy rule
- **HW2** : Using swarm intelligence

The case.txt format and physical rule is written in [rule.pdf](https://github.com/ramadepo/Ncu-ComputationalIntelligence/blob/master/rule.pdf).
